## Installation
> Query the SQL file.
> Then start the ac-text ac-shop ac-hacking scripts in the script
> Add the items to your server
> And as a final step, read the steps and start using the script.
> You also need to install this script for the prop system to work https://github.com/Demigod916/object_gizmo

## REQUIRED ITEM 
To build a computer you need any of these
ac_desk1
ac_desk2
ac_desk3
ac_desk4

After setting up the computer, you need to put these things in it to run it
ac_cpu
ac_gpu
ac_hdd
ac_vpn

You need any one of these to build a miner
ac_server1
ac_server2
ac_server3
ac_server4
ac_server5

These are the types of gpu you put inside the miner
ac_gpu_miner_1
ac_gpu_miner_2
ac_gpu_miner_3
ac_gpu_miner_4


### If you get the error No suck export acHackingGetHackData in resource ac-lib-2, make sure you start ac-lib-2 before ac-hacking. ###

## STEPS ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ### ###
Step 1 / Getting started and Mining system
We need a computer desk, we craft this desk and create it with the prop menu
For the computer to work we need hdd, cpu and gpu, we place them in the computer with the build system
Then we craft miner racks and create them, we can't build a miner rack without a computer
After installing the miner racks, we enter the computer, install the minerEXT application from the appstore and connect the miner rack and the computer
We can crafting butcoin thanks to the gpulars we will put in miner racks
We can put a maximum of 10 GPUs in a rack. The better quality our GPUs are, the more butcoins we can produce accordingly. All of these things are set in the config, we can show the config in a part of the video.
In addition, thanks to the miner application we downloaded from the appstore, we can also mine with the gpu we use to run the computer.
Thanks to the special durability system of each item and the independent inventory inside the system, these items such as gpu, cpu hdd are depleted and deteriorate as they are used.

Step 2 / Hack , Wifi Systems
To send butcoin to a person, we need wifi to use the drone app
To connect to the wifi, we enter the salty application, find the ip and mac addresses here with the 1 coin we are mining and take note of them.
Then we enter this ip and mac into the smoke crack application, complete the minigame, complete the crack process and connect to wifi
Each ip and mac address has a different difficulty, for example, if you crack with a Hard Level ip and mac, the computer stays connected to the wifi for 24 hours, but it is difficult to do this
You can crack easier with Easy Level but you will be connected to wifi for 6 hours


Step 3 / Drone application introduction
You can buy new gpu, cpu or hdd from the drone app.
For this you need butcoin and you need to be connected to wifi
If you meet these requirements, an NPC will be waiting for you at the location marked on the map and you will be able to go and pick up the item.


Binunce App
Butcoin exchanges between everyone in the game are recorded here and you can view them


General Information
You can change the background of the computer
You can view how long you will be connected to WiFi or your connection status
You can view and delete notifications in bulk
You can disable apps related to the appstore from the config if you want and it will show as not available in the game and you can turn it on whenever you want.
You cannot use apps you have not installed
With drag drop you can move apps around as you like and it is saved
When you create a computer, your username crytpo address mac address is automatically generated and you can exchange coins with other people.
